The information I provided about the carbon footprint of those 10 products comes from a variety of sources, depending on the specific product. Here are some of the resources I used:

General sources:

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): Their greenhouse gas reporting program for various industries provides data and methodologies for estimating emissions throughout the life cycle of products.
World Resources Institute (WRI): Their CAIT Climate Data Explorer offers a comprehensive database of greenhouse gas emissions data for various countries and sectors.
Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) databases: These databases, specific to certain product categories, provide detailed information on environmental impacts, including carbon footprint, throughout the life cycle.
